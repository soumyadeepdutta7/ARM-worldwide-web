# Eternia by Hindalco - Frontend Assignment

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the Eternia website homepage, built according to the provided Figma design.

## Features implemented

- Fully responsive layout for Desktop and Mobile devices.
- Pixel-accurate implementation of the Hero Banner and floating Navbar.
- Use of the modern React and Astro framework for optimal performance.
- Clean and reusable components (`Navbar.tsx` and `Hero.tsx`).
- Smooth hover and scroll animations for a premium look and feel.

## Tech Stack

- Astro (Framework)
- React (UI Library)
- Vanilla CSS (Styling)
- Lucide React (Icons)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:4321`. Check your terminal for the exact URL.

## Assumptions

- Only the Home Page (Navbar and Hero Section) was implemented for this phase, as instructed.
- The `lucide-react` library was used to implement icons matching the provided design.
- The design features a dark-themed layout, so an appropriate background image was chosen to reflect the "Luxury aluminium windows" theme.
- The floating frosted-glass effect on the Navbar is implemented using CSS `backdrop-filter`.
